Turner syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal disorder affecting females characterized by short stature and gonadal dysgenesis. Untreated girls with TS reportedly are approximately 20-cm shorter than normal girls within their respective populations. The growth patterns of girls with TS also differ from those of the general population. They are born a little smaller than the normal population possibly due to a mild developmental delay in the uterus. After birth, their growth velocity declines sharply until 2 years of age, then continues to decline gradually until the pubertal age of normal children and then drops drastically around the pubertal period of normal children because of the lack of a pubertal spurt. After puberty, their growth velocity increases a little because of the lack of epiphyseal closure. A secular trend in height growth has been observed in girls with TS so growth in excess of the secular trend should be used wherever available in evaluating the growth in these girls. Growth hormone (GH) has been used to accelerate growth and is known to increase adult height. Estrogen replacement treatment is also necessary for most girls with TS because of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Therefore, both GH therapy and estrogen replacement treatment are essential in girls with TS. An optimal treatment should be determined considering both GH treatment and age-appropriate induction of puberty. In this review, we discuss the growth in girls with TS, including overall growth, pubertal growth, the secular trend, growth-promoting treatment, and sex hormone replacement treatment.


Turner syndrome is a rare condition in women that is associated with either complete or partial loss of one X chromosome, often in mosaic karyotypes. Turner syndrome is associated with short stature, delayed puberty, ovarian dysgenesis, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, infertility, congenital malformations of the heart, endocrine disorders such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis and autoimmune disorders. Morbidity and mortality are increased in women with Turner syndrome compared with the general population and the involvement of multiple organs through all stages of life necessitates a multidisciplinary approach to care. Despite an often conspicuous phenotype, the diagnostic delay can be substantial and the average age at diagnosis is around 15 years of age. However, numerous important clinical advances have been achieved, covering all specialty fields involved in the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome. Here, we present an updated Review of Turner syndrome, covering advances in genetic and genomic mechanisms of disease, associated disorders and multidisciplinary approaches to patient management, including growth hormone therapy and hormone replacement therapy.


In their study, Nadesapillai et al. ( 1 ) set out to answer a critical question, namely, “Based on karyotype, puberty status, and hormonal data, which girls with Turner syndrome (TS) could benefit from fertility preservation by ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC)?” The question is crucial because signs of a depleted ovarian reserve are often encountered at an early age, so OTC could be a way of preserving the follicle pool of these girls before premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) occurs. Indeed, only a third of girls with TS enter puberty, although the majority experience POI at a young age because of extensive and accelerated follicle apoptosis. Natural conception is infrequent, with only 5.6% of a series of 500 women with TS conceiving spontaneously. Moreover, miscarriage rates are twice as high as in the general population. Interestingly, a number of studies have demonstrated the presence of follicles in the ovarian cortex in girls with mosaic TS. These investigators, in collaboration with our team, recently showed ( 2 ) that small follicles from patients with mosaic TS undergo folliculogenesis after their frozen-thawed ovarian cortex is grafted to nude mice. It was concluded that OTC could be a valid option to preserve fertility in young patients with mosaic TS when sufficient numbers of follicles are present, preferably before the age of 12 years. Very recently, Dunlop et al. ( 3 ) reported the first clinical pregnancy in a patient with TS who conceived naturally after autotransplantation of her cryopreserved ovarian tissue, which had been biopsied at the age of 15 years. Unfortunately, the pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage. Years earlier, Donnez et al. ( 4 ) had achieved a successful pregnancy and live birth (LB) in a patient with mosaic TS and POI after allografting ovarian tissue from her monozygotic twin, who still had ovarian function despite her own TS mosaicism. A second pregnancy and LB followed 2 years later.


This article discusses the influence of a chromosome condition affecting women's reproductive capacity, Turner Syndrome (TS), on affected women's social timing, examining the strategic decisions that are made within families in relation to reproduction, to navigate these disruptions. Based on photo elicitation interviews with 19 women with TS and 11 mothers of girls with TS in the UK, it presents findings from an under-researched topic, TS and reproductive choices. In a social context where motherhood is not only desirable, but expected (Suppes, 2020), the social imaginary of infertility anticipates a future of unhappiness and rejection, an undesirable condition that should be avoided. Accordingly, mothers of girls with TS often expect that their daughter will want to have children. Infertility diagnosed in childhood has a distinctive impact on reproductive timing, as future options may be anticipated for years. This article uses the concept of 'crip time' (Kafer, 2013) to explore how women with TS and mothers of girls with TS experience temporal misfitting based on a childhood diagnosis of infertility, and manage, resist and re-frame this to minimise stigma. The 'curative imaginary' (Kafer, 2013), a social norm where disabled people are expected to desire a cure for their condition, is used as an analogy for infertility, describing how mothers of girls with TS respond to social pressure to plan for their daughter's reproductive future. These findings may be useful both for families navigating childhood infertility and practitioners who support them. This article demonstrates the cross-disciplinary potential of applying disability studies concepts to the context of infertility and chronic illness, where concepts shed new light on the dimensions of timing and anticipation in this context, improving our understanding of the lived experience of women with TS, and how they view and use reproductive technologies.


Turner syndrome (TS) is tightly associated with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and ovarian dysgenesis, typically resulting in infertility in the great majority of patients. Therefore females with TS are usually treated with female sex steroids from 11-12years of age until the normal age of natural menopause of around 53-54years of age. Infertility is rated among females with TS as a distressing concern and a detractor from a good quality of life. Options for motherhood for females with TS has expanded during recent years. Originally, only adoption was an option, unless of course for the small minority of TS females that still has ovarian function and are capable of achieving pregnancy through normal means. Oocyte donation has become the mainstream option in many countries and seems to work well, especially if patients have been treated with optimal estrogen and gestagen for a prolonged time before the intervention. It comes with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and TS oocyte donation pregnancies are viewed as high risk pregnancies necessitating increased vigilance. Oocyte cryopreservation of own oocytes is also becoming an option in a select group of TS and has special challenges. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation is a promising new techniques that has been applied successfully in children with cancer. Currently, several trials are running around the world evaluating this techniques in TS. The genetics and genomics behind the ovarian dysgenesis seen in TS is not understood, but new studies have elucidated global changes in DNA methylation and RNA expression in blood from persons with TS and it is likely that similar changes are present in the ovaries. We still, however, need more thorough research to fully uncover the genetic background of ovarian failure in TS. Gene expression studies and methylation analysis from ovarian TS tissues still needs to be performed.


There is increasing interest in fertility and use of assisted reproductive technologies for women with Turner syndrome (TS). Current parenting options include adoption, surrogacy, and spontaneous and assisted reproduction. For women with TS, specific risks of pregnancy include higher than usual rates of spontaneous abortion, foetal anomaly, maternal morbidity and mortality. Heterologous fertility assistance using oocytes from related or unrelated donors is an established technique for women with TS. Homologous fertility preservation includes cryopreservation of the patient's own gametes prior to the progressive ovarian atresia known to occur: preserving either mature oocytes or ovarian tissue containing primordial follicles. Mature oocyte cryopreservation requires ovarian stimulation and can be performed only in postpubertal individuals, when few women with TS have viable oocytes. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation, however, can be performed in younger girls prior to ovarian atresia – over 30 pregnancies have resulted using this technique, however, none in women with TS. We recommend consideration of homologous fertility preservation techniques in children only within specialized centres, with informed consent using protocols approved by a research or clinical ethics board. It is essential that further research is performed to improve maternal and foetal outcomes for women with TS.

Objective: This case report discusses a 27-year-old woman diagnosed with mosaic Turner syndrome and altered ovarian reserve, seeking infertility management. The patient underwent in vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for aneuploidy to prevent Turner syndrome transmission. A literature review was conducted on the utility of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in Turner syndrome. The search identified one study meeting the inclusion criteria. Both the reviewed study and the reported case involved mosaic Turner syndrome patients who underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles, followed by embryonic biopsy for PGT. Euploid embryos were transferred, resulting in the birth of healthy girls with normal karyotypes. Conclusion: Mosaic Turner syndrome patients might benefit from preimplantation biopsy and genetic analysis to prevent genetic defect transmission to offspring.

Objective: This study investigates pubertal presentations and progressions before and after estrogen induction therapy in Turner syndrome patients, correlating with karyotypes. The records of 66 patients diagnosed with Turner syndrome were reviewed. The patients were categorized into 45,X monosomy, X chromosome structural abnormalities, and X mosaicism groups. Pubertal presentations were classified into spontaneous puberty, arrested puberty, and no spontaneous puberty. Karyotypes were highly correlated with pubertal presentations. Estrogen induction therapy induced puberty, with the tempo approximating spontaneous puberty. Low-dose estrogen mimicked puberty, and FSH levels provided predictive information for pubertal induction.

Turner syndrome (TS) results in premature ovarian insufficiency and infertility. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) is an emerging fertility preservation strategy for females with TS. This report presents the first clinical pregnancy in a TS patient, conceived naturally after the re-implantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue removed after spontaneous puberty. This establishes proof of concept for OTC as a fertility preservation method in TS.

Pregnancy is a critical consideration for patients with Turner syndrome (TS). While natural pregnancies occur in a minority, assisted reproductive technologies, particularly oocyte donation, are often necessary. Maternal mortality risk is higher due to cardiovascular anomalies, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary screening before pregnancy. The screening includes assessing aortic diameters, blood pressure, and various biological parameters. Beta-blockers and aspirin may be used for hypertension and pre-eclampsia prevention, respectively. Collaborative care involving endocrinologists, cardiologists, and obstetricians is crucial during and after pregnancy, ensuring a safe outcome.

Many women with Turner syndrome (TS) express a desire to become pregnant. While a small percentage may achieve spontaneous pregnancies, assisted reproductive technology (ART), particularly oocyte donation (OD), has expanded opportunities. However, emerging evidence highlights the high-risk nature of pregnancy in women with TS, primarily due to potential aortic dissection and rupture, along with a notable risk of hypertensive disorders. The maternal mortality rate is estimated at around 2%, significantly higher than the general population. Current counseling relies on anecdotal experiences, consensus opinions, case reports, and data obtained from national health registries, though imperfect due to varying methodologies. The 2012 American Society for Reproductive Medicine Practice Committee Opinion suggests TS is a relative contraindication for pregnancy, with specific criteria for cardiac abnormalities as absolute contraindications. However, there is an ongoing challenge in defining what constitutes a "significant" abnormality. Aortic dilation, coarctation of the aorta, and bicuspid aortic valve are recognized risk factors, but questions remain about rapid changes in aortic dimensions during pregnancy and the impact of various cardiac lesions. There is insufficient data to guide appropriate screening, assess morbidity and mortality risks during pregnancy, and determine necessary long-term follow-up. Moreover, there is a need for educating obstetricians about these potential risks to enhance patient care.

The cardinal features of Turner syndrome (TS) encompass short stature, congenital abnormalities, and infertility due to gonadal dysgenesis, leading to premature ovarian failure and subsequent sex hormone insufficiency. This hormone insufficiency contributes to various aspects of health, including increased cardiovascular risk, physical fitness, insulin resistance, body composition, and a higher incidence of autoimmunity. Severe morbidity and mortality affect females with TS, emphasizing the crucial role of proper sex hormone replacement therapy (HRT) throughout their lifespan. Recent research underscores the significance of timely and comprehensive HRT, and new hypotheses involving estrogen receptors and genetics provide valuable insights. This review discusses the effects of estrogen and androgen insufficiency, along with the impact of sex HRT on morbidity and mortality, emphasizing evidence-based research and identifying areas that require further investigation.
