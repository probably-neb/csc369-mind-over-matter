KRAS mutational activation promotes cancers in various tissues, yet the clinical characteristics of specific mutant KRAS alleles remain unclear. Analyzing samples from colorectal, pancreatic, lung, and blood plasma cancers, this study investigates allele- and tissue-specific genetic properties associated with oncogenic KRAS mutations. While known mutagenic mechanisms explain some allele frequencies, substantial differences suggest biological selection underlies tissue-specific mutant allele frequencies. The analysis reveals distinct tissue-specific communication networks and genetic dependencies associated with specific mutant KRAS alleles, emphasizing the allele- and tissue-specific complexity driving clinical consequences.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is anticipated to become the second leading cause of death in the next decade. Despite advancements in diagnostics and new chemotherapeutic regimens, the prognosis for PDAC remains grim. The oncogenic KRAS mutation is a key driver in pancreatic cancer, providing permanent activation of the KRAS protein, initiating various intracellular signaling pathways, and inducing cell proliferation, migration, transformation, and survival. Detecting KRAS mutations using methods like digital droplet PCR, especially in fine-needle aspiration material, enhances the sensitivity, accuracy, and negative predictive value for diagnosing pancreatic cancer.

Genomic and epigenomic screening techniques have improved our understanding of pancreatic cancer. High-frequency mutated genes, such as KRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, and SMAD4, are associated with specific core signaling pathways. Histological precursors of pancreatic cancer exhibit distinct molecular alterations, identified through genomic screening. Familial pancreatic cancer cases involve various responsible genes, and epigenetic changes play a crucial role in disease progression. Genetically engineered mouse models based on the Kras mutation provide valuable tools for identifying key molecules in pancreatic cancer development.

To detect minority mutant KRAS alleles among abundant wild-type alleles, a sensitive DNA sequencing assay, Pyrosequencing, has been developed. This method, particularly useful for tumors with abundant non-neoplastic cells, shows superior mutation detection rates compared to dideoxy sequencing, especially in paraffin-embedded tissues. It offers a simple, robust, and sensitive approach with a detection limit of approximately 5% mutant alleles.

Targeting KRAS mutations has been a long-standing challenge, but recent breakthroughs with KRAS (G12C) inhibitors, such as sotorasib and adagrasib, represent a significant advancement. However, resistance to monotherapy with KRAS inhibitors has been observed. Understanding resistance mechanisms is crucial, and combination therapies are being explored to achieve long-term clinical responses.

Survival in KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer relies on reprogrammed metabolism, including elevated macropinocytosis, autophagy, and lysosomal degradation. Ultra-pH-sensitive micelles (UPSM) with pH-specific buffering and rapid drug release show promise in inhibiting lysosomal catabolism, inducing apoptosis, and demonstrating superior safety and efficacy in mouse models.

Combining antifibrotic nanoparticles and siRNA-loaded biomimetic nanoparticles provides a sequential-targeting strategy for pancreatic cancer therapy. This approach regulates TGF-β signaling, reverses activated cancer-associated fibroblasts, and interferes with oncogenic KRAS, resulting in improved lifespans in pancreatic tumor-bearing animals.

In pancreatic cancer patients, ctDNA analysis by digital polymerase chain reaction proves to be a useful noninvasive diagnostic tool. K-ras mutations in ctDNA correlate with poorer survival rates, especially the G12V mutation, highlighting the potential of ctDNA analysis for diagnosis and prognostication.

Despite therapeutic advances, PDAC remains challenging. Combining CDK4/6 inhibitors with ERK–MAPK inhibitors shows synergistic suppression of PDAC cell growth. CRISPR-Cas9 screening identifies diverse genes that enhance CDK4/6 inhibitor activity, providing potential therapeutic combinations and insights into resistance mechanisms.

The complexity of PDAC is exemplified by the variability in reported KRAS mutation frequencies. Next-generation high-coverage sequencing reveals a higher frequency of KRAS mutations (∼93%), but the allelic ratios vary. Sensitivity in sequencing technologies influences the perceived prevalence of KRAS mutations, emphasizing the need for nuanced interpretation of genomic data.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a dismal prognosis, prompting investigations into predictive biomarkers for treatment response and outcomes. This study examined KRAS mutations at codons 12/13 in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from preoperative and postoperative sera of PDAC patients undergoing pancreatectomy. Results showed that changes in KRAS mutation status between preoperative and postoperative cfDNA could serve as a predictive biomarker for survival and treatment response, providing valuable insights for personalized therapy.

The KRAS signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in PDAC development, and recent improvements in survival have been observed with the combination of taxane nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) and gemcitabine. This study explored the interactions of conventional paclitaxel and experimental taxane SB-T-1216 with the KRAS signaling pathway in PDAC models. While taxane administration led to a downregulation of the KRAS signaling pathway, no significant differences were observed based on KRAS mutation status, emphasizing the need for further investigations into predictive biomarkers.

Casein kinase II (CK2) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are implicated in PDAC, and inhibitors of these proteins have been explored as potential therapeutics. This study investigated the effects of silmitasertib and dinaciclib on PDAC cell lines, revealing pronounced and cell line-specific effects on cell death induction. The efficacy of inhibitors did not correlate with target gene expression or identified gene variants, highlighting the complexity of individual responses to these inhibitors.

The diagnosis of pancreatic cancer often occurs at an advanced stage due to the lack of early detection biomarkers.
