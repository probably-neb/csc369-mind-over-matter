{"title": "d5.txt", "text": "Familial Attributes\n\nGenetic and environmental conditions shared in families may contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain (28, 29). The cellular mechanisms that link inflammation, peripheral sensitization and pain can be modified by complex interactions between the genome and environment (30).\n\nGenetics:\n\nHeredity may play a significant role in defining an individual\u2019s back pain risk. Genetic association has been reported for structural factors such as disc degeneration, disc herniation, disc height loss, osteophytes, lumbar stenosis, and Modic changes (31)  (32). Additionally, some evidence associates genetic variations related to expression of structural matrix proteins as well as pain perception and pain sensitivity (33) (34). Personality traits, the tendency to experience certain emotional states, and pain responding all have heritable components (35).\n\nTwo included studies discuss evidence for genetic mechanisms and describe genetic variants that increase susceptibility to sciatica (one RPF with little SOE confidence) and self-reported cLBP (one RFP with little SOE confidence). \n\nDemographics:\n\nEpidemiologic factors that associate with cLBP include age, sex (chromosomal assignment at birth), ethnicity which is inherited through family and culture and is often oversimplified to race, and inheritance which is the main way that wealth or the lack thereof is transferred between generations. In cLBP, we see a higher prevalence in women versus men, higher prevalence in Whites and Blacks vs Hispanics, and higher odds with low income and lower level of education. \n\nOne study considered how gender (two RPF with little to some SOE confidence) and age (two RPF with little to some SOE confidence) are associated with lifting and carrying capacity tests.\n"}
