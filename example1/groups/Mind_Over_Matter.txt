Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disease characterized by an excessive number of CAG trinucleotide repeats within the huntingtin gene (HTT). Patients with HD can manifest various symptoms, such as chorea, behavioral and psychiatric abnormalities, and cognitive decline. Each patient presents a unique combination of symptoms, and while various medications and non-drug treatments can manage them, there is currently no cure for the disease. Therapies for HD are categorized based on the symptoms they address, including chorea medication, antipsychotic medication, antidepressants, mood-stabilizing medication, and non-drug therapies. Ongoing clinical trials explore new HD therapeutics targeting the origin of the disease, aiming to reduce mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) levels. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies, RNA interference (RNAi) therapies, RNA targeting small molecule therapies, stem cell therapies, antibody therapies, non-RNA targeting small molecule therapies, and neuroinflammation-targeted therapies are among the potential treatments in development. Additionally, Zinc-Finger Protein (ZFP) therapies, transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) therapies, and CRISPR/Cas therapies are being explored in pre-clinical development. This comprehensive review evaluates the efficacy of current HD treatments and provides insights into the clinical trial progress of emerging potential HD therapeutics.

Huntington’s disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited progressive neurological disorder characterized by chorea, involuntary brief movements flowing between body regions. Diagnosis is typically based on clinical findings, often within a family history context, and can be confirmed with genetic testing. Multiple areas of the brain degenerate, impacting neurotransmitters like dopamine, glutamate, and γ-aminobutyric acid. Despite theoretical targeting of these neurotransmitters through pharmacotherapies, few well-conducted trials for symptomatic interventions have yielded positive results. Current treatments mainly focus on the motor aspects of HD. Tetrabenazine, a dopamine-depleting agent, is considered effective for reducing chorea, albeit with potential serious adverse effects. Some newer neuroleptic agents like olanzapine and aripiprazole show promise with a more favorable adverse effect profile. HD lacks treatments altering its course, and current approaches involve education and symptomatic therapies. This review explores the challenges and tools available to clinicians working with patients and families affected by HD.
